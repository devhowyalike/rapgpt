# Community Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Community feature has been successfully implemented, allowing users to:

- Browse all registered users in the community
- View individual user profiles with their public battles
- Publish/unpublish battles to their public profile
- Control their profile privacy settings

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**File**: `src/lib/db/schema.ts`

Added two new fields:

- `isPublic` (boolean, default: false) to `battles` table - Controls battle visibility on profiles
- `isProfilePublic` (boolean, default: true) to `users` table - Controls profile visibility

**Migration**: `drizzle/0001_slimy_harry_osborn.sql`

### 2. New Pages

#### Community Page

**File**: `src/app/community/page.tsx`

- Route: `/community`
- Displays all registered users in a responsive grid
- Shows user avatars, display names, and join dates
- Each user card links to their profile page
- Decrypts and displays user names from encrypted database fields

#### User Profile Page

**File**: `src/app/profile/[userId]/page.tsx`

- Route: `/profile/[userId]`
- Shows user information (avatar, display name, join date)
- Displays public/private profile badge
- **For public profiles**: Shows all published battles (`isPublic = true`)
- **For private profiles**: Shows "Private Profile" message to others
- **For own profile**: Shows all battles with publish controls and privacy toggle

### 3. Updated Components

#### Site Header

**File**: `src/components/site-header.tsx`

- Added "Community" navigation link with Users icon
- Positioned between Archive and Admin links

#### My Battle Card

**File**: `src/components/my-battle-card.tsx`

- Renamed "Share" to "Share Link" for clarity
- Added "Publish Battle" / "Unpublish Battle" option in three-dot menu
- Shows Globe icon for Publish, Lock icon for Unpublish
- Added visual "Public" badge on published battles
- Real-time toggle without page refresh

#### User Button

**File**: `src/components/auth/user-button.tsx`

- Added "My Profile" menu item that links to user's profile page
- Fetches database user ID via API endpoint

### 4. New Components

#### Profile Privacy Toggle

**File**: `src/components/profile-privacy-toggle.tsx`

- Client component for toggling profile privacy
- Shows on user's own profile page
- Provides instant feedback with loading state
- Refreshes page after toggle to update badges

### 5. API Endpoints

#### Toggle Battle Public Status

**File**: `src/app/api/battle/[id]/toggle-public/route.ts`

- Method: PATCH
- Route: `/api/battle/[id]/toggle-public`
- Toggles `isPublic` field for a battle
- Verifies user ownership before allowing changes

#### Toggle Profile Privacy

**File**: `src/app/api/user/toggle-profile-privacy/route.ts`

- Method: PATCH
- Route: `/api/user/toggle-profile-privacy`
- Toggles `isProfilePublic` field for authenticated user

#### Get Current User

**File**: `src/app/api/user/me/route.ts`

- Method: GET
- Route: `/api/user/me`
- Returns current user's database ID and profile privacy status

## User Experience

### For New Users:

1. Sign up and automatically appear in the Community page
2. Profile is public by default
3. All battles are private by default

### Publishing Battles:

1. Go to "My e-Beefs" page
2. Click three-dot menu on any battle
3. Select "Publish Battle"
4. Battle now appears on public profile

### Profile Privacy:

1. Visit your own profile via "My Profile" link in user menu
2. Click "Make Profile Private" button
3. Profile still appears in Community but no battles visible to others
4. Click "Make Profile Public" to reverse

### Viewing Others:

1. Go to Community page
2. Click on any user
3. See their public battles (if profile is public)
4. Or see "Private Profile" message (if profile is private)

## Security Features

- All user actions are authenticated via Clerk
- Battle ownership is verified before allowing publish/unpublish
- Sensitive user data (names, emails) remains encrypted in database
- Only decrypted on server-side when needed for display

## Styling

- Consistent purple theme matching existing design
- Backdrop blur effects and gradient backgrounds
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Responsive grid layouts for mobile and desktop
- Status badges with icons (Globe for public, Lock for private)

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Migration**: Run `pnpm drizzle-kit push` or manually apply SQL
2. **Test Features**: Verify all functionality works as expected
3. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add battle count to Community user cards
   - Add search/filter functionality to Community page
   - Add activity feed or recent battles section
   - Add user statistics to profile pages
