# Clerk Auth Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation of Clerk authentication with role-based access control for RapGPT.

## ✅ Completed Components

### Phase 1: Core Setup

- ✅ Installed Clerk (@clerk/nextjs) and svix for webhooks
- ✅ Created TypeScript types for roles (`src/types/globals.d.ts`)
- ✅ Created encryption utilities (`src/lib/auth/encryption.ts`)
- ✅ Created role utilities (`src/lib/auth/roles.ts`)
- ✅ Set up Clerk middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
- ✅ Wrapped app in ClerkProvider (`src/app/layout.tsx`)

### Phase 2: Database Schema

- ✅ Created `users` table with encrypted fields
- ✅ Created `comments` table (replacing JSONB)
- ✅ Updated `battles` table with `created_by` and `is_featured`
- ✅ Updated `votes` table with foreign key and unique constraint
- ✅ Generated database migrations (`pnpm db:generate`)

### Phase 3: Webhook & User Sync

- ✅ Created webhook endpoint (`src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`)
- ✅ Handles `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted` events
- ✅ First user automatically gets admin role
- ✅ Encrypts user data before storing

### Phase 4: Authentication UI

- ✅ Created sign-in page (`src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Created UserButton component (`src/components/auth/user-button.tsx`)
- ✅ Created ProtectedAction component (`src/components/auth/protected-action.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated site header with auth UI

### Phase 5: Protected APIs

- ✅ Updated vote API to require authentication
- ✅ Updated comment API to require authentication
- ✅ Comments now save to database table with user reference
- ✅ Votes tracked in database with duplicate prevention
- ✅ Created battle deletion API

### Phase 6: Admin Features

- ✅ Created admin dashboard (`src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- ✅ User management interface
- ✅ Battle management with delete functionality
- ✅ Admin battle creation page (`src/app/admin/battles/new/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Creates featured battles (isFeatured: true)

### Phase 7: User Features

- ✅ Created user battles page (`src/app/my-battles/page.tsx`)
- ✅ List user's personal battles
- ✅ Share links and delete functionality
- ✅ User battle creation page (`src/app/my-battles/new/page.tsx`)
  - ✅ Creates personal battles (isFeatured: false)

### Phase 8: Homepage & Archive

- ✅ Updated homepage to show only featured battles
- ✅ Dynamic buttons based on auth status
- ✅ Updated archive to show only featured battles
- ✅ Updated `getFeaturedBattles()` in battle-storage

### Documentation

- ✅ Created comprehensive setup guide (`AUTH_SETUP.md`)
- ✅ Environment variables documented
- ✅ Encryption key generation instructions
- ✅ Webhook configuration steps

## ⚠️ Remaining Work

### Critical - Battle Sidebar Updates

The `src/components/battle-sidebar.tsx` needs significant updates:

#### Vote Button Updates

- [ ] Wrap vote buttons in `<ProtectedAction>`
- [ ] Remove localStorage vote tracking (now in database)
- [ ] Show "Sign in to vote" for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Check vote status from API/database instead of localStorage

#### Comment Form Updates

- [ ] Remove username input field
- [ ] Get username from Clerk session
- [ ] Wrap comment form in `<ProtectedAction>`
- [ ] Show "Sign in to comment" for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Display user avatars next to comments

#### Comment Display Updates

- [ ] Fetch comments from new database table
- [ ] Merge with legacy JSONB comments
- [ ] Show user profile pictures
- [ ] Display encrypted display names

### Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Add displayName editor for users
- [ ] Admin role management UI in dashboard
- [ ] User profile page with stats
- [ ] Battle ownership indicators
- [ ] Comment edit/delete functionality

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

1. **Authentication**: Clerk handles all auth flows
2. **Encryption**: User emails, names, and display names encrypted at rest
3. **Role-Based Access**: Middleware protects admin routes
4. **Vote Integrity**: Database unique constraint prevents duplicate votes
5. **Cascade Deletion**: Deleting battles/users cascades to comments/votes
6. **Session Validation**: All protected APIs verify authentication

## 📊 Database Schema

### New Tables

- `users`: User accounts with roles
- `comments`: New comments with user references

### Updated Tables

- `battles`: Added `created_by`, `is_featured`
- `votes`: Added foreign key to users, unique constraint

### Cascade Behavior

```
users (deleted) → comments (deleted)
users (deleted) → votes (deleted)
battles (deleted) → comments (deleted)
battles (deleted) → votes (deleted)
```

## 🎭 Role System

### Public (Unauthenticated)

- View featured battles
- View archive
- Cannot vote or comment

### User (Authenticated)

- All public features
- Vote on battles (once per round)
- Comment on battles
- Create personal battles at `/my-battles/new`
  - Manage own battles

### Admin (Authenticated)

- All user features
- Create featured battles at `/admin/battles/new`
- Access admin dashboard at `/admin/dashboard`
- View all users
- Delete any battle

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete

1. **Update Battle Sidebar** (CRITICAL)

   - This is the main remaining UI component
   - Follow the plan in the "Remaining Work" section above
   - Test thoroughly with authenticated/unauthenticated states

2. **Test End-to-End**

   - Sign up as first user (becomes admin)
   - Test creating featured battle
   - Sign up second user (becomes user)
   - Test creating personal battle
   - Test voting and commenting
   - Test battle deletion

3. **Run Database Migration**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:push
   ```

4. **Configure Clerk**

   - Follow `AUTH_SETUP.md`
   - Set up webhook
   - Add environment variables

5. **Deploy**
   - Push to production
   - Update webhook URL in Clerk
   - Sign up immediately to claim admin!

## 🎉 Summary

The core Clerk authentication system with role-based access control is **95% complete**. The main remaining work is updating the battle sidebar component to integrate with the new authentication system. All backend APIs, database schema, admin features, and user pages are fully implemented and ready to use.

Once the battle sidebar is updated, the system will be fully functional and ready for deployment!
